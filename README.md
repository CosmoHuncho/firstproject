# firstproject

My name is Anderson, and I have been studying HTML for a week. Up to this point, I know how to do most of the basics in HTML but still have to learn how to implement CSS to style my webpages. This project will serve to practice my ability using HTML and expand my knowledge by forcing me to use external resources to complete this project.

Skills that this project will highlight:

1. How to set up a homepage
2. How to link pages within my website
3. How to implement ordered and unordered lists
4. How to organize HTML code
5. Using git through the Ubuntu terminal
